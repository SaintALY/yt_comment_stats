UgxdCYMrxI1yA03XWRx4AaABAg,"I'm a developer and currently about 100% of my income is still based on hourly labor. 
Frankly, I can't seem to find any niche or business idea that isn't already a thing times 50 existing companies. My best prospects for passive income is making a bit of profit on providing hosting or other common web services to my clients with a little markup, but that isn't very sustainable.
Second problem is that my business is at a weird juncture where there is plenty of work to keep me busy, but not enough to warrant hiring someone.
I've begun a Roth IRA and have some crypto holdings but there is a long way to go for that route.
I'm not the type to try and be some internet influencer and try to captivate audiences and grow a following, I don't do anything special enough for people to want to follow me for it.

UgxMxTgpayQPQewuUCp4AaABAg,"I love your honest take on passive income. It bothers me that so many people act as if you can make money with no effort. It takes A LOT of effort to build a business or any gig that can eventually run on its own. Even then, you still need to do maintenance. A massive advantage that is not usually talked about is having an audience. If you have an audience, it is easier to get some of these smaller projects off the ground. A lot of people fail because they try to sell an e-book with no audience.

UgyAmPYSu5z_deXOCGV4AaABAg,"I have a 9-5 that pays pretty well and is somewhat interesting to me but can also be very slow and boring. And while it pays well it doesn‚Äôt get me to where I‚Äôd like to be financially.

But your videos made me realize that with a main job, there are a ton of fun and interesting side jobs I could pursue during my down time. Because my main job gives me a stable career, I could literally do anything I want on the side. It could be a fun side job and all the extra money (even if it‚Äôs not a ton of money) can be saved/invested on top of what I already earn.

I really love researching products and writing. A part-time job writing reviews for products I enjoy would be a blast. I could easily do that for hours especially since I have a lot of extra boring downtime after work and on weekends.

I think I will look for ways to do that starting today!

Thanks for the video, I have been feeling stuck and this got my imagination going for ways to change things up. üëç",2 weeks ago,Frogturtle xd,UC4_r9dSlsjid28qNm9eNLXA,1,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQqtWpBahuw376PZfxFa8Hom2bTHroBqUf3Jm7g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0.0

Ugzwqgx23_vtE0ntCmp4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm so excited that my 13 year old son just told me about this really cool video he found. He wants to go to college at Baylor and knows it‚Äôs expensive so he is already looking for ways to make money and came across this video.  

This is such great advice all around. As a dad who has tried to discuss business with him, he always wants to tell me about some YouTuber who makes millions and I just bite my tongue.  

I am so thankful that he discovered a YouTuber who is actually telling him something truthful and worthy of the time spent (which most videos on YouTube are not).  I had to take time to comment.

Grateful,
