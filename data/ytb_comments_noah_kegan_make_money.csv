Frankly, I can't seem to find any niche or business idea that isn't already a thing times 50 existing companies. My best prospects for passive income is making a bit of profit on providing hosting or other common web services to my clients with a little markup, but that isn't very sustainable.
Second problem is that my business is at a weird juncture where there is plenty of work to keep me busy, but not enough to warrant hiring someone.
I've begun a Roth IRA and have some crypto holdings but there is a long way to go for that route.
I'm not the type to try and be some internet influencer and try to captivate audiences and grow a following, I don't do anything special enough for people to want to follow me for it.

It takes A LOT of effort to build a business or any gig that can eventually run on its own. Even then, you still need to do maintenance. A massive advantage that is not usually talked about is having an audience. If you have an audience, it is easier to get some of these smaller projects off the ground. A lot of people fail because they try to sell an e-book with no audience.

But your videos made me realize that with a main job, there are a ton of fun and interesting side jobs I could pursue during my down time. Because my main job gives me a stable career, I could literally do anything I want on the side. It could be a fun side job and all the extra money (even if it‚Äôs not a ton of money) can be saved/invested on top of what I already earn.

I really love researching products and writing. A part-time job writing reviews for products I enjoy would be a blast. I could easily do that for hours especially since I have a lot of extra boring downtime after work and on weekends.

I think I will look for ways to do that starting today!

Being an entrepreneur or successfully self employed (even as a dancer/former interpreter, yours truly) requires stacking several different skills
-budgeting/financial literacy
-time management
-sitting with ones deficiencies and doing something about it 
-**the actual skill you want to get paid for**
-openness to being very wrong and receiving constructive criticism
-openness to meet people and ability to detect who‚Äôs for your growth and who isn‚Äôt
-courage and confidence to be new at something
-courage and confidence to problem solve problem after problem
-ability to see a solution or know it‚Äôs somewhere in your mind or in the mind of someone in your community

I feel a lot of people are wanting to get paid without having a skill stack like this... @Silicon Valley Girl talks a lot about this on her YouTube and her 1+ million subscribers.

I followed most, if not all of these tips, but maybe I‚Äôm just not a good entrepreneur and I can‚Äôt get any of my side hustles to takeoff after five to six years and ten on youtube. I think a more realistic route for me is to live below my means and choose a job I love and try to grow my salary, while seeking remote opportunities that allow for travel. 
I think a lot of social media hypes Tim Ferriss and all the success stories like ali but there‚Äôs a survivorship bias there. Not all of us are great entrepreneurs or great on YouTube. I‚Äôve put out over 1500 YouTube videos and started many hustles, but I still suck at it. I‚Äôm trying to improve. I haven‚Äôt given up. I‚Äôm patient. But I think the lesson is that sometimes the employee route may be a more viable one that still allows you to find your passion. Not saying that is easy either.
